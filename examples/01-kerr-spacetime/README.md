# Example 1 - Kerr orbits

This elementary example illustrates how SIM5 library can be used in a C program and in a Python script to calculate locations of particular orbits in Kerr spacetime. It prints/plots location of marginally stable orbit, marginally bound orbit, photon orbit and the radius of the black-hole horizon.

**Reminder:** *Marginally stable orbit* is the innermost orbit, where free particles are stable against radial perturbations and can orbit along circular orbits. *Marginally bound orbit* is the innermost spherical orbit which is bound to the central black hole. *Photon orbit* is a region of space where gravity is just strong enough that photons are forced to travel in orbits around the central black hole.  

## Running in C
```bash
make
./kerr-spacetime
```

## Running in Python
```bash
python kerr-orbits.py
```
